Lag Analysis

Is there a lag between a change in Bitcoin’s price being reflected in a change in network hashpower?

- Bitcoin’s price is mainly an indicator of demand for Bitcoin, supply shocks are not possible since the issuance schedule is set in stone
- Price is a function of several variables, demand for Bitcoin can be affected by various factors
- Miners have to decide if it’s profitable to mine at a given point in time, among other factors this decision is primarily influenced by:
    - Price of Bitcoin
    - Availability of mining hardware
    - Increase in transaction fees
    - Cost of electricity
- The amount of hashpower in the network conveys information about these factors
- Increase in hashpower could be because new miners enter the market or existing miners buy up more computation
- how does an increase in the price of bitcoin impact a miner’s decision to increase their hardware resources
- Considering there is an increase in network hashpower in response to an increase in price, how long does it take for this cause-effect chain to be visible as an increase in network hashpower?
- Miners cannot instantly acquire additional mining capacity, and because of this it is possible that the network hashrate could be a indication of an increase in price that took place a few weeks before
- Is it possible to find out if there is a lag in response and observe how much of a lag there is between price increase leading to an increase in hashrate?

- Things to be careful about:
    - How do miners decide to purchase more hardware? How much of an increase in price would tell them to be more confident about buying more hardware?
    - Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment happens every two weeks and it’s main purpose is to ensure that the time between blocks is roughly 10 minutes
    - An increase in difficulty necessitates increased computation in order to successfully mine a block. This makes it unprofitable for some miners to continue participating and they decide to exit the network. This could lead to a slight decrease in network hashrate

Analysis Design:
- Identify periods with noticeable increase in BTC price
- After this period, investigate how hash rate changes in blocks of 2 weeks and 4 weeks after a lag of 1 to 15 weeks
- The objective is to understand if there’s a pattern with regards to a lag between hash rate increasing in response to increase in price
- Increase in hashrate is defined as percentage growth compared to the week that observed an increase in price
